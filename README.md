# D3 V4 - What's new?

Based on the excellent [Change log](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#table-of-contents) 
from @mbostock and other collected notes.

### To run locally:

- clone this repo
- run `make setup` to install gems
- run `make dev` to start local development server.
- run `make build` to build the slides into the `build/` folder of this repo.

When development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4567` to see 
an index of all the slides.

These slides use:

* Remark.js
* Middleman (using a highly stripped down version of [Remarkymark](https://github.com/camerond/remarkymark)).
